      <el-collapse-item title="6 Stereotype-Smashing Muslim Women in Team Orange" name="1">
        <div>On International Women’s Day 2020, meet the stereotype-smashing, marathon racing and brave mountaineering women of Team Orange!

          Team Orange are our incredible volunteering and fundraising family, who give their time open-heartedly to help those in need. One of the core parts of Team Orange is taking part in Challenges, from skydiving to climbing Mount Everest, to raise money for charity.

          In a society that still marginalises Muslim women, we couldn’t be prouder of the sisters who defy expectations by taking on tough challenges to provide for refugees, the poor and the disadvantaged around the world. Here are just a few of their stories…</div>

      <el-collapse-item title="The True Importance of Women in Islam" name="2">
        <div>Despite misconceptions, the status of women in Islam is that of a beloved equal. In the midst of a deeply sexist historical context, the Prophet (saw) preached boldly on the importance of women; celebrating their unique contributions to family and society, condemning the ill-treatment of women and campaigning for their rights.

          Many of the negative stereotypes around women in Islam arise not from Islamic guidance but from cultural practices, which not only denigrate the rights and experiences of women, but also stand in direct opposition to the teachings of Allah (swt) and His Prophet (saw).

          Far from the stereotype of the voiceless and veiled Muslim woman, Shaykh Ibn Baaz argues, “There is no doubt that Islam came to honour to the woman, guard her, protect her from the wolves of mankind, secure her rights and raise her status.”</div>

      <el-collapse-item title="Ebrima’s Story: How a Rural Mosque is Changing Lives in The Gambia" name="3">
        <div>A Mosque is at the heart of any Muslim community; it’s a holy space for everyone to come together, pray and worship Allah (swt), learn to read and recite the Qur’an and strengthen their relationships with others, and their relationship with Islam itself. However, not every Muslim has the opportunity to pray and learn in a local Mosque – in many countries, this is but a distant dream.

          Thanks to The Mosque Project and our generous donors, Penny Appeal are able to give the lift-changing gift of a Mosque to deprived communities around the world. Recently, we built a beautiful Mosque in the Foni Bintang-Karanai area of The Gambia, for over 350 rural Muslims. Their village is largely agricultural and extremely poor; until now, there had never been a Mosque in their community before.</div>

      <el-collapse-item title="10 Amazing Years of Penny Appeal" name="4">
        <div>Penny Appeal has spent the last decade doing some pretty amazing things for people all over the world. From building wells to taking action in times of tragedy, we’ve been around since 2009 with one goal in mind: to provide relief to people in need throughout Africa, Asia, the Middle East and right here at home in the UK.

          For the past 10 years, we’ve been transforming lives and strengthening communities across the globe – all thanks your help! Together, we’ve lifted people out of poverty, provided clean, safe water to entire villages, helped orphans get an education and grannies get the care they deserve. We’ve built school and mosques, and jumped into action during emergencies. We’ve protected women and children from abuse and helped thousands of communities prosper. We took on challenges together and came out for some seriously fun events – all in the name of charity!</div>
